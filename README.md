### Hi, I'm Ryan Floyd ðŸ‘‹ 

I have an unending curiosity for learning how technology works. I've built my own computers, explored cybersecurity and Machine Learning, modded video game consoles, and more, but ultimately my passion is web development! I specialize in JavaScript, React, and Node.js, but I'm almost always learning new web technologies so I can see my ideas and my programming come to life.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning Three.js to create 3D graphics in the browser. Checkout my [Dev.to article](https://dev.to/mrryanfloyd/create-an-interactive-3d-portfolio-website-that-stands-out-to-employers-47gc) on how I created my 3D portfolio site [Ryan-floyd.com](https://www.ryan-floyd.com) with three.js, which got over 4,000 views and 70 reactions!

âš¡ I'm looking to break into the software engineering industry, ideally with a frontend software engineer position! âš¡
