I'm <a href="https://x.com/0xFloyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xFloyd</a>, a senior software engineer at <a href="https://pluto.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pluto</a>. I previously worked as an engineer at <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockheed Martin</a>. I'm currently interested in building personalized, custom AI and automation solutions. I build fast, clean, reliable products, and I enjoy working with TypeScript and React. I've spent the past few years shipping web apps, tools, APIs, and libraries. I'm the person who handles the full cycle from idea to launch — I've done this my whole career.

My skillset is taking a product from rough concept to prototype to production, especially in fast-moving environments where you need to make a lot of decisions on your own. I work across the stack — frontend, backend, APIs — my specialty is simply solving problems and figuring things out without losing momentum.

If you have an idea you want to build, react out on twitter (preferred) or to xfloyd.eth [at] gmail [dot] com. I'm happy in my current full-time role, but if you're building something ambitious and need a senior engineer, I'm always happy to chat.
