### I really love computers.

Hi, I'm [0xFloyd](https://github.com/0xFloyd), a senior software engineer and potato farmer at [Pluto](https://pluto.xyz), where I'm currently working on software for automating browser use with LLMs. Previously, I built projects for [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf), where I worked on the [first-ever Builder proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2). I've also worked as a software engineer at [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com). I describe myself as a [techno-optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto) and futurist. I'm interested in disruptive software, focusing on the intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence.

I build fast, clean, and reliable software products, and I particularly enjoy working with TypeScript and React. I've spent the past few years building everything - from web apps, tools, and APIs, to libraries, onchain dApps, and chrome extensions. My skillset is guiding products from rough concept through prototyping to production, fast.

If you have an idea you need help building, reach out on [twitter](https://x.com/0xFloyd).
