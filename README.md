### I really love computers.

Hi, I'm [0xFloyd](https://github.com/0xFloyd), a senior software engineer at [Pluto](https://pluto.xyz). I'm currently building at the intersection of cryptography and AI - shipping tools to automate browser workflows with LLMs and trusted hardware using TEEs. I'm interested in disruptive technology, and I describe myself as a [techno-optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto) and futurist.

Previously, I built several projects for [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf) - including [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com) _(the first [builder proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2))_ and [Nouns Party](https://nouns.wtf/vote/3) _(a way to fractionalize Nouns)_. Before that, I was a software engineer at [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com). I’ve also shipped a variety of freelance projects for startups and individuals, mostly in the crypto space.

My work spans developer automation SDKs, retrieval-augmented AI assistants, WASM-based proof generation, onchain integration, and npm libraries. While TypeScript and React are my preferred stack, I've shipped everything from web apps and APIs to npm SDKs, NFT projects, and Chrome extensions.

I love hobby projects and tinkering - my favorite project was [running my own Ethereum node](https://x.com/0xFloyd/status/1701651748597756046) on my own hardware from 2023 - 2024.

If you have an idea you need help building, reach out on [Twitter](https://x.com/0xFloyd).
