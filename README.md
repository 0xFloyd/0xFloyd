### Hi, I'm Ryan Floyd ðŸ‘‹ 

I have an unending curiosity for learning how technology works. I specialize in JavaScript, React, and Node.js, but I usually learn something new every single day. I've yet to encounter a problem I couldn't solve. 

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning Three.js to create 3D graphics in the browser. Checkout my [Dev.to article](https://dev.to/mrryanfloyd/create-an-interactive-3d-portfolio-website-that-stands-out-to-employers-47gc) on how I created my 3D portfolio site [Ryan-floyd.com](https://www.ryan-floyd.com) with three.js, which received over 10,000 views! The gif below shows the site.

âš¡ I'm looking to break into the software engineering industry, ideally as a frontend software engineer! âš¡
