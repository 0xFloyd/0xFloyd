### I really love computers

Hi, I'm <a href="https://x.com/0xFloyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xFloyd</a>, a senior software engineer at <a href="https://pluto.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pluto</a>. I previously worked as an engineer at <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockheed Martin</a>. I describe myself as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">techno-optimist</a> and futurist. I'm interested in disruptive software, specifically cryptography and artificial intelligence. I love building. I've done it my entire life - from legos in my childhood, to minecraft worlds in my teens, to software for the rest of my life.

I build fast, clean, and reliable software products, and I particularly enjoy working with TypeScript and React. I've spent the past few years shipping web apps, tools, APIs, and libraries. My skillset is taking a product from rough concept, to prototype, to production, especially in fast-moving environments where I have the freedom to make autonomous decisions. I like to own the full idea-to-launch cycle.

If you have an idea you want to build, reach out on twitter (preferred) or to xfloyd.eth [at] gmail [dot] com
