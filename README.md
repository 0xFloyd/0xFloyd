### I really love computers.

Hi, I'm <a href="https://x.com/0xFloyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xFloyd</a>, a senior software engineer at <a href="https://pluto.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pluto</a>, where I’m currently working on software for automating browser use with LLMs. I previously worked as an engineer at <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockheed Martin</a>. I describe myself as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">techno-optimist</a> and futurist. I’m interested in disruptive software, focusing on the intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence.

I build fast, clean, and reliable software products, and I particularly enjoy working with TypeScript and React. I've spent the past few years shipping web apps, tools, APIs, and libraries. My skillset is guiding products from rough concept through prototyping to production, fast.
