### I really love computers.

Hi, I'm [0xFloyd](https://github.com/0xFloyd), a senior software engineer and potato farmer at [Pluto](https://pluto.xyz). I build at the intersection of cryptography and AI—currently shipping tools to automate browser workflows with LLMs and trusted hardware using TEEs. I'm interested in disruptive technology, and I describe myself as a [techno-optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-Optimist_Manifesto) and futurist.

Previously, I built projects for [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf) ([first Builder proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2)) and worked as a software engineer at [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com). I've also shipped a variety of freelance projects for startups and individuals.

My work spans developer automation SDKs, retrieval-augmented AI assistants, WASM-based proof generation, and npm libraries designed for developer experience. While TypeScript and React are my favorite stack, I've shipped everything from web apps and APIs to npm SDKs, onchain integrations, and Chrome extensions.

I don't work alone—Sonnet 4 is always with me.
